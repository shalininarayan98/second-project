# The Brief

- You are required to create a service-orientated aThe core service 
– Service 1: this will render the Jinja2 templates you need to interact with your application, it will also be responsible for communicating with the other 3 services, and finally for persisting some data in an SQL database.rchitecture for your application, an application must be made composed of at least 4 services that work together.
- Service 2 and 3: These will both generate a random “Object” of your choice
- This service will also create an “Object” however this “Object” must be based upon the results of service #2 + #3 using some pre-defined rules.
- The other constraint in this project is the technologies that need to be used. The project needs to utilise the technologies discussed during the training modules. 

        •	Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board 

        •	Version Control: Git 

        •	CI Server: Jenkins 

        •	Configuration Management: Ansible

        •	Cloud server: GCP virtual machines 
    
        •	Containerisation: Docker 
- With this project brief in mind, I am going to create a app that generators a prediction for the user's 2020. this will be done by generating a random letter, a random number and using these two combinations to generate a prediction.
